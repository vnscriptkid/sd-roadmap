## Kafka

- Message stream
- Components: producer, broker, consumers
- Producer:
  - can have many publishers
  - 2 steps: (1) determine the partition based on key if exists or partition strategy (2) determine the broker where partition resides in
  - acks: wait for replicas to be in sync before responding, one or all
- Queues
  - Topic
    - Organize same type of messages into a logical group
    - Topic can have many partitions
  - Partitions
    - Unit of parallelism, allow multiple messages can be processed at a time
    - Each partition holds an exclusive subset of messages of one topic
    - Partitions are distributed across brokers to ensure fault tolerance
    - Each partition has
      - 1 leader replica: handle all reads and writes
      - Many follower replicas (# based on replication factor): incase leader replica goes down, one of follower replica will take over
- Consumers
